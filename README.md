# Amazon Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project involves the analysis of Amazon customer data to gain valuable insights into customer behavior and product reviews. The primary objective is to explore the dataset, answer specific questions, and visualize the results for better understanding. Below, you will find a detailed guide on how the project was conducted and what it aims to achieve.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project was imported from an SQL Lite database. It contains various attributes related to Amazon customers, products, and reviews.

## Data Pre-processing
Before performing any analysis, the data required preprocessing to ensure accuracy and relevancy. This preprocessing step involved cleaning and organizing the data, handling missing values, and converting data types where necessary. The cleaned dataset was used as the foundation for subsequent analysis.

## Analysis and Visualizations
#### 1. Which users should Amazon make more recommendations to?

To answer this question, an analysis was conducted to identify users who are more likely to benefit from Amazon's product recommendations. The results were visualized using a bar chart, providing a clear representation of the target audience for enhanced recommendations.

#### 2. Which product has a good number of reviews?

This question aimed to determine which products on Amazon have garnered a substantial number of reviews. The analysis identified such products and visualized the findings through a bar chart, offering insights into the most reviewed items.

#### 3. Difference in behavior between frequent and non-frequent customers.

To better understand customer behavior, the dataset was segmented into frequent and non-frequent customers based on predefined criteria. A bar chart was used to illustrate any significant differences in their behavior, helping Amazon tailor its strategies accordingly.

#### 4. Do frequent customers leave more detailed reviews?

This analysis delved into whether frequent customers tend to leave more detailed reviews compared to their non-frequent counterparts. A box plot was employed to visualize any disparities in the level of detail in customer reviews.

#### 5. Sentiment Analysis of Reviews.

In addition to quantitative analysis, sentiment analysis was performed on customer reviews to gauge the overall sentiment (positive or negative) associated with specific products. This information can be valuable for identifying products with favorable or unfavorable customer sentiment.

## Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of Amazon customer data, offering insights into customer behavior, product reviews, and sentiment. The visualizations presented in this project aid in making data-driven decisions to improve Amazon's customer experience and product recommendations. Future work may involve more in-depth analysis and the exploration of additional questions to further enhance Amazon's understanding of its customer base.
